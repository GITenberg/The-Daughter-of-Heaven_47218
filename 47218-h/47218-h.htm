<h4>PREFACE</h4>


<p>
Thoroughly to understand China, one must realize that it has for three
hundred years cherished in its heart a deep and continually bleeding
wound. When the country was conquered by the Manchus of Tartary, the
ancient dynasty of the Mings was forced to yield the throne to the Tzin
invaders, but the Chinese nation never ceased to mourn the ancient
dynasty nor to hope for its restoration. Revolution is therefore a
permanent thing in China&mdash;a fire which smoulders eternally, breaking
into flame in one province only to be smothered and blaze out again
presently in another.</p>

<p>No doubt the Yellow Empire is too immense to permit of complete
understanding among the revolutionaries, or of collective effort to
break off the Tartar yoke. Several times, nevertheless, the Chinese
race has been near to victory. When, some twenty years ago, certain
events, which Europe never really understood, brought about an upheaval
in China, the revolutionaries, victorious for a time, proclaimed at
Nang-King an emperor of Chinese blood and of the dynasty of the Mings.
His name was Ron-Tsin-Tse, which means: The Final Flowering, and by
the faithful his era was called Tai-Ping-Tien-Ko, which is as much as
to say: The Empire of the Great Celestial Peace. He reigned seventeen
years, concurrently with the Tartar Emperor at Pekin and almost within
the shadow of that city.</p>

<p>Later, the authorities forced a complete suppression of his history:
all records of it were confiscated and burned, and men were forbidden,
under penalty of death, even to utter his name. Here, however, is the
translation of a passage relating to him which occurs in a voluminous
report addressed by the Tartar general Tsen-Konan-Wei, to the Emperor
at Pekin:</p>

<p>"When the revolutionaries rose in the province of Chan-Tung (he
says) they possessed themselves of sixteen provinces and six hundred
cities. Their guilty chief and his criminal friends had become really
formidable. All their generals fortified themselves in the places they
had taken, and not until they had stood three years of siege were we
again Masters in Nang-King. At this time the rebel army numbered more
than two hundred thousand men, but not one of them would surrender.
The moment they perceived themselves lost they set fire to the palace
and burned themselves alive. Many of the women hanged or strangled
themselves, or threw themselves into the lakes in the gardens. However,
I succeeded in making one young woman prisoner, and pressed her to tell
me where the Emperor was. 'He is dead,' she replied; 'vanquished, he
poisoned himself.' But immediately the new Emperor was proclaimed in
the person of his son, Hon-Fo-Tsen. She led me to the old Emperor's
tomb, which I ordered broken open. In it was found in fact the
Emperor's body, enveloped in a shroud of yellow silk embroidered with
dragons. He was old, bald, and had a white mustache. I caused his body
to be burned and his ashes to be thrown to the winds. Our soldiers
destroyed all that remained within the walls: there were three days and
nights of killing and pillage. However, one troop of several thousands
of rebels, very well-armed, succeeded in escaping from the city,
dressed in the costumes of our dead, and it is to be feared that the
new Emperor was able to escape with them."</p>

<p>This Emperor, Hon-Fo-Tsen, who, in fact, did succeed in fleeing from
Nang-King, was looked upon by the real Chinese as their legitimate
sovereign, and his descendants in secret no doubt reigned after him
uninterruptedly.</p>

<p>Several years ago a very remarkable man, who seemed to incarnate in
himself the new China, dreamed of a pacific and genuine reconciliation
of the two inimical races. (He had many dreams indeed: one of them,
for instance, that of founding the United States of the World.) He
conceived the almost unrealizable project of converting to his ideas
the Emperor at Pekin himself and of securing his help to reform China
without the spilling of any blood. His name was Kan-You-Wey. To get
near the Emperor he opened a school at Pekin in 1889.</p>

<p>Many rumors, though very conflicting ones, were in circulation
concerning the personality of this invisible Emperor Kwang-Su, kept as
he was under strict guardianship, like a captive in the heart of his
palace and so unknown to everyone. Some versions declared him alert,
well-read, interested in modern things; others represented him as
feeble in body and spirit, given to excesses and incapable of action.</p>

<p>Kan-You-Wey would believe only in the favorable version: he knew
besides What the ministers of the Dowager Regent were worth, masters
with her of the Imperial power. He pitied the Imperial victim. His
whole heart turned toward his sovereign because he was unhappy. How
could he reach him in his quadrupled walls? How win the attention of
his melancholy idol? Kan-You-Wey ten times renewed his attempts, with
the zeal of an apostle, and succeeded finally, in 1898, thanks to one
of his disciples, in putting before the Emperor a memorial that he had
prepared for him.</p>

<p>Then the phantom-sovereign roused himself. Much struck with these
insurgent ideas, he wanted them explained to him in detail, and gave an
audience to the reformer. He surrendered at once to the influence of
this great spirit, made him his minister, intimate and confidant; and,
sustained by his counsel, achieved at last the control of his affairs.</p>

<p>It is at this moment of the reign of Kwang-Su that our play takes
place. The Emperor himself is the hero, and Kan-You-Wey figures in it
under the name of Fount-in-the-Forest.</p>

<p>Yes, I hear&mdash;&mdash;but I would rather see.</p>

<p>Beautiful sights are not for us to see.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIR-SAPLING</p>

<p>Yes! we know that. Our duty is to work on in
silence,&mdash;patiently to prepare the beauty of the festival
which is not for our eyes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRONG-ARM</p>

<p>Are you complaining?&mdash;&mdash;Every creature must accept the
place in life which falls to its lot.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ROCK</p>

<p>That law governs all. There are some animals that are proud
and splendid, birds with magnificent plumage, and there are
also rats and horrible insects, which inspire loathing.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">HUMPBACK</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that chance favours the most humble.
Listen to me. Though I was in no way to blame, I have
witnessed a sight which I was forbidden to see.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">STRONG-ARM</p>

<p>You? You have witnessed such a sight?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIR-SAPLING</p>

<p>What was it? Tell us.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">HUMPBACK</p>

<p>Well, it was yesterday, after sundown. The other gardeners
had just gone away; I had not yet finished my task, but
remained to polish one of those great marble lions, at the
Gateway of State. I was working all unsuspicious, when
suddenly I heard the great drum and the clanging of the
bell, and I saw the watchers descend from their tower to
open the great gate. The guards and generals and ministers
were all running. I heard it said that the new arrival
was the most important of all the invited guests, the
Viceroy of the Southern Provinces. How could I make my
escape in the midst of all these wonderful personages? It
was impossible! I hid behind one of the huge paws of the
lion and made myself very small. No one took any notice of
me&mdash;&mdash;and I saw, I saw through the pierced globe, you know,
which the lion holds in his clutch&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIR-SAPLING</p>

<p>You saw the Viceroy of the South enter with his retinue?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">HUMPBACK</p>

<p>Yes, I saw! Oh! such costumes of silk and gold! Such horses
shining with gems! Such banners! And some terrible faces,
too, some glances awful in their pride!&mdash;&mdash;But when he
came, oh! then I understood that besides him all the others
counted for naught. He was pale, with a very weary air, on
a horse led by two attendants&mdash;&mdash;His costume was simple,
but seemed richer than all the others&mdash;&mdash;He was so imposing
that my heart would no longer beat in my breast, and it
seemed to me that if only he turned his unseeing eyes
towards me, I should drop dead.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIR-SAPLING</p>

<p>Ah, was it like that? If one feels like that for no more
than a Viceroy, how would it be if one were gazed upon by
the Emperor himself?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">HUMPBACK</p>

<p>But I assure you, no one who has not seen him can&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIR-SAPLING</p>

<p>Hush! Hush! Here comes a Palace official.</p>

<p>So this is the way you do your work? You fritter away in
foolish chatter the few precious moments which are left.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">HUMPBACK</p>

<p>The work will be finished, my Lord.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>Will be finished! What, when I see the ground still strewn
with petals and dead flower&mdash;&mdash;and here, of all places,
around the Pavilion of the Ladies-in-Waiting. [<i>Aside</i>]
where blooms that living flower whom I adore.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">HUMPBACK</p>

<p>No sooner have we put all straight than the spiteful wind
shakes the branches and we have to begin all over again.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>Remove them from the moss, at all events&mdash;&mdash;Those faded
flowers look like so many stains.</p>

<p>CINNAMON [<i>in a whisper</i>]</p>

<p>I thought I recognised the voice of my lord Arrow-Bearer.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRANQUIL BEAUTY</p>

<p>Golden Lotus recognised it before you.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">PEARL</p>

<p>That young man is always stealing about here.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRANQUIL BEAUTY</p>

<p>We all know the reason.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">CINNAMON</p>

<p>See, he greets our companion as if she were a Queen.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRANQUIL BEAUTY</p>

<p>Is she not the Queen of his heart?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>The breeze of spring time caresses me gently and
intoxicates me with the perfume of the lotus.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRANQUIL BEAUTY</p>

<p>The allusion is evident.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">CINNAMON</p>

<p>It is well known that The breeze of springtime signifies
love.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">PEARL</p>

<p>And her name is Golden Lotus.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS [<i>to</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</span>]</p>

<p>My lord, I heard that you ordered the flowers to be
removed&mdash;&mdash;Was I misinformed?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>I dared to raise my voice to give that order&mdash;&mdash;Can I have
displeased you?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</p>

<p>Oh! no&mdash;&mdash;But I desire to ask your indulgence for the
lovely dead flowers. Permit them to remain there as a
carpet at the foot of our pavilion. Though broken from
their stems, they are still beautiful and keep their
perfume.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>What glory for me to obey you! I envy those flowers which
will be trod by your little feet.</p>

<p>Enough, Golden Lotus. It is not proper for us to listen to
such remarks.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>Have you nothing more to say to me?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRANQUIL BEAUTY</p>

<p>Let us go. Come, we must return to the Pavilion.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</span> [<i>to</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRANQUIL BEAUTY</span>]</p>

<p>My lord, you know news travels slowly to the quarters Of
the Ladies-in-Waiting, and my curiosity is eager on this
most solemn day, when our Empress is to restore the throne
of the bright dynasty of the Mings and to take on her
the regency of the Empire. At what precise hour will the
festival begin? DO you know the order of the ceremonies?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>What great pleasure for me to be able to inform you. The
Criers Of the Minister of Rites proclaimed last night the
order of the ceremonies. I have taken note of what I heard.
[<i>He takes from his sleeve a small scroll</i>] I hope to write
several poems about this later. It is a date quite unique
in the annals of China.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</p>

<p>Oh! read it to us, my lord.</p>

the precious objects which they have in their keeping
so as to place them, according to the due rites, on the
six golden tables in the Palace of Great Purity. Let the
Master-in-Chief of the Music place orchestras and singers
in the galleries and in the Throne-room. As soon as the
last watch shall have sounded, let the Astrologer go to
inform Her Majesty the Empress that the chosen hour has
come when she must repair to the Temple of her Ancestors
to offer the prescribed sacrifices to the August Shades.
Her Majesty will be attended only by the Princesses and Her
Ladies-in-Waiting.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRANQUIL BEAUTY</p>

<p>By us!&mdash;&mdash;Then let us return to the Pavilion, we must
prepare at once.</p>

<p>We shall be told when it is time.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</span> [<i>continuing to read</i>]</p>

<p>From the Temple of Ancestors to the Palace of Great Purity,
let all Dignitaries, Officers, Guards, Secretaries form
up in a line on either side of the road along which the
Empress will pass in a palanquin, ornamented with dragons
and phoenixes, to the foot of the staircase leading to the
throne-room, where the grand ceremony of investiture will
take place.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</p>

<p>Will women be present at that?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>Yes, the Princesses and the Ladies-in-Waiting will form the
retinue of the Empress and group themselves about her.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</p>

<p>Ah! I was not sure&mdash;&mdash;It was that particularly which I
wished to know.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>The young Emperor will be close to the brave mother
who is to reign in his name. Reign, you know how!
Reign in mystery, in anguish, faced by insurmountable
difficulties&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</p>

<p>How many hearts beat for Her, how many strong arms are
ready to defend Her!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRANQUIL BEAUTY</p>

<p>Have all the invited guests arrived at the Palace?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>I believe so. The most powerful of all, the Viceroy of the
South, has been lodged not far from here, in the Pavilion
of Limpid Fountains. If the bushes were not so leafy you
would be able to see the roof of his residence from your
Pavilion.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">CINNAMON</span> [<i>In a whisper</i>]</p>

<p>I should love to get a look at the Prince.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</p>

<p>One question more, my Lord. Does not some new danger
threaten us? Dark rumours have reached us&mdash;&mdash;Are our
reconquered Provinces well garrisoned?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>Alas! even during the hours of joy, anxiety assails us.
Alas that, when the delicious perfume of a flower caresses
us, we must watch with dread the storm which is always
threatening on the horizon. The gazelle had a little
respite because the tiger was wounded. If he recovers, he
will immediately begin again the pursuit of his prey.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</p>

<p>What is the meaning of that allusion?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>That the Tartar Emperor, who reigns at Peking and considers
us, the dispossessed Chinese, as rebels, has just been
vanquished in the war which the dangerous Western
Barbarians made against him. With great difficulty he has
obtained peace, and he has not yet recovered from the
effects of his defeat.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</p>

<p>Ah! yes, the rumor of that war came to us. But what was the
cause of it?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRANQUIL BEAUTY</p>

<p>How politics interest her!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">PEARL</p>

<p>Yes! when that young man is her teacher.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>The cause of it was peculiar. A Prince, kinsman to the
Tartar usurper, conceived the foolish idea of mustering
an army of bandits to hurl upon the hated Christians in
the north of China. But the horde, once let loose, got
out of hand. It rushed against the barbarian strangers,
whose presence has for a long time been tolerated in the
neighbourhood of the Palace. Then the armies of the Western
nations came to sack Peking, whence the Tartar Emperor fled
with his entire Court.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</p>

<p>Doubtless it is unhappy for us that the usurper has made
peace&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</p>

<p>Who knows? Perhaps China might have fallen under a more
evil dominion still.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRANQUIL BEAUTY</p>

<p>Is the lesson not finished yet?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</span> [<i>withdrawing</i>]</p>

<p>It is time, my lord, for us to prepare for the festival.</p>

<p>It is you who will beautify the setting.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</p>

<h5>SCENE IV</h5>


<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR EMPEROR</span>, <i>disguised as the Viceroy of the
South, with</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT-IN-THE-FOREST</span>, <i>his minister.</i></p>

<p class="p2" style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>I see no one&mdash;&mdash;Your Majesty may come forward.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Your Majesty! Do you wish to ruin me?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>Oh! Sire.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Again!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>When we are alone, I cannot refrain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>You must&mdash;&mdash;Behind those blinds, probably spies are
watching us.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>Eaves-droppers, rather. That is the Pavilion of
Ladies-in-Waiting.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>The Pavilion of the Ladies-in-Waiting&mdash;&mdash;So there are also
Ladies-in-Waiting here? In very truth, it seems to me that
I am dreaming. Yet I knew what I came hither to find that
after three centuries of reign the Emperors of my dynasty
had never succeeded in subduing the secret resistance of
the conquered&mdash;I knew that. That in the Southern Provinces
the rebels had never yet bowed the head, aye, I knew that.
That Nanking was their capital and that here a descendant
of the Mings had even reigned. For more than seventeen
years before being crushed by our armies, of all that I
was aware&mdash;&mdash;But I thought this phantom empire was more
mysterious, more hidden in the dark, and here I find a
palace as beautiful as mine, with guards, dignitaries,
ministers, a ceremonial regulated as at my own Court&mdash;&mdash;Our
Empire is too large it seems, to be governed by one head
alone&mdash;&mdash;I wished to see with my own eyes. I was prepared
for all surprises, yet this is beyond me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He sits down on a bench under a tree in full
bloom.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>What is more surprising still is that you are here unknown
to all; here in the midst of your implacable enemies, and
clad in the fashion of three hundred years ago.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>It is a happy coincidence that this Viceroy of the South
whose place I have taken is of my build&mdash;&mdash;What can he be
thinking of this adventure, in the ship where he is now
held a prisoner for me? What can he imagine, do you suppose?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>Anything&mdash;except the truth.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Yet if he should escape, would I not be lost indeed?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>My heart feels as though in a vice. Are you not lost in any
case?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Silence! After all, what have I to risk? My life? Under the
shadow of that throne from which they would banish me, is
not life an unending agony? With what crushing weight do
the slow hours fall upon me. Who can describe the horror
of that indolent stagnation, of that idle solitude? Oh!
the rage which consumes the soul, when one is the Master
and yet has no power! If I find death here, I shall be a
thousand times happier for having come. All my unhappy
existence down to the present has not been worth as much
to me as these last few days of flight and travel, this
rapture of escape, for a time, from that grey, silky web
wherein I am a prisoner. Oh! to work, to work in the
sunshine, to work like a man, to attempt some daring act,
which, if I die, will at least remain behind to honour my
memory.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>You are wonderful, you are noble, you are fearless. But I,
who am as nothing, I have the right to tremble.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>It is you, however, who have awakened my spirit, who have
aroused it from its deadly torpor; it is you who have
inspired me with will and strength. Have you not approved
of my project? Have you not found noble, and worthy of a
sage, the dream which carried me away.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</span> [<i>kneeling before the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span>]</p>

<p>I cried aloud with enthusiasm, I wept with emotion when I
grasped your sublime thought&mdash;&mdash;But it is an impossible
dream, and the wish to realise it is a madness as generous
as it is vain. I fear for you, Sire, my well beloved
Master, I fear!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>You fear what? Up to to-day has not my plan worked out as
if by magic.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>Up to to-day, yes, I cannot deny it.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>My departure from the Palace, which seemed so perilous&mdash;not
an obstacle! You, my dear minister, enter your official
palanquin, I was at your side in the costume of your
Secretary! I smiled, you remember, like a schoolboy playing
truant. My manner was so gay as to frighten you.&mdash;&mdash;And
your poor little secretary, your pupil, as dear to you
as a son, consented to take my place in my bed with its
funereal silk draperies, in that sepulchral chamber, railed
and walled in again and again, where one stifles with the
perfumes which are too sweet. If I come through safe, what
can I do in recognition of this boy's tremendous devotion,
who acted as substitute for the martyr which I was, who
entered into the mummied body of an Emperor of China?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>Will he know how to play the part which he assumed?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Oh! it is an easy part, that of sovereign in my sad, closed
room. One sleeps, reads, meditates, and keeps one's self
from doing more. I have made use of the weapon which is so
often used against me. I have been accused of being ill
when I am not so. This time it is I that pretend. Who will
dare to doubt?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>And the doctor who is taking care of the mock Emperor&mdash;are
you sure of his fidelity?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>My doctor? What interest would he have in betraying me? He
thinks I am engaged in some affair of gallantry and I have
promised him a province if my absence is not discovered.
He is watching his patient carefully and has strictly
forbidden anyone to go near him.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>That is capital!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Even in my city of Peking there is no risk of my being
recognised, since none of my subjects have even seen my
face. Flight is made easy for an invisible emperor! And
once on the ship&mdash;so freighted with your anxiety, do you
remember? what rapture it was to fly through space, light
as the cloudlets of smoke which followed in our track!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>It is true, the kidnapping of the Viceroy and his
companions was the more dangerous feat, but our sailors
managed it marvellously. The immortals are with us, your
Majesty.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Poor little Viceroy! As the escort who came to greet him
had never seen him, nothing was simpler than that I should
be taken for him. I told you, Fount-in-the-Forest, that all
must be as simple as child's-play!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>Sire! Did you compose novels of adventure they would
be more interesting even than those of the famous Lo
Kwan-chung.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Well, you see, they left me but two things in my splendid
solitude; love and opium. Opium exalts the imagination, and
I have had plenty of leisure to dream about my plans.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>I plan out the future in my writings&mdash;prophetically,
perhaps, but then I leave to the generations that are to
come the duty of fulfilling my prophesies. You, Sire,
are offering your own blood as a sacrifice to assuage
unconquerable hate. The Immortal gods shall bow to you as
to their equal: but those on whom you wish to heap your
kindness will destroy you.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Who knows? Hatred often yields to love.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>Not such immemorial hatred as this. Nothing has softened
it, and for these three hundred years it has not even
known the weakness of a love affair. Never has a Tartar
married a Chinese woman, never has a Chinese loved a Tartar
woman. During the three years since you issued the decree
authorising marriages between the two races, none have
availed themselves of the permission.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Yes, there has been one marriage&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>One marriage! One of your courtiers, to please you, married
the daughter of one of your ministers; and do you recall
the number of favours by which you have had to repay that
act of sacrifice?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>You are, however, a Chinese, and I believe that you love me
a little.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>On me alone you have shed the light of your soul; and I,
moreover, have cast away the prejudices which fetter life.
I love you and I admire you.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Well, that is my recompense&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>Someone is coming! We must take care&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They are pretty.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>And so gracefully dressed! It makes me regret the fact that
my victorious ancestors imposed the Tartar costume on the
people. These Chinese robes are so much more beautiful.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>They make the women appear more slender and delicate.</p>

<p>Do all the inhabitants of the city garb themselves in the
old way?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>In their homes, no doubt, they do. Out of doors, in the
streets, they still keep up a pretence of wearing the new.</p>

<p>The Viceroy whom I sent to Nanking is certainly not
ignorant of all this. Why has he not informed us?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>Your Viceroy, Sire, is not a Tartar, but a Chinese, which
means that he espouses the cause of the rebels. Yet at
Peking, outside the walls of your Palace of Eternal
Silence, what goes on is fairly well known. While you are

this little gift.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>Yes! I felt with you the emotion of that chance
encounter&mdash;&mdash;But let calm descend upon your soul. You will
need all your composure not to betray yourself during the
ceremony of the robing, for this time you are not playing
the leading part. Do not forget the three obeisances, the

bend the knee to another.</p>

of the faithful people and of the army ready to die for

sacred treasure, the priceless trust which your ancestors
have transmitted to us from generation to generation&mdash;the

To the end that you may accomplish the work of your deified
ancestors, never forget the ten precepts which are the rule
of conduct of all sovereigns. As they are engraved here on
the precious jade, it is my privilege to read them to you
this day in the hearing of all.</p>

Listen to wise counsels.<br />

Spare the treasury.<br />
Avoid the allurements of the senses!<br />
</p>

<p>Obeying these commands, one is sure to follow in the right
path. But one must advance along this road without turnings
aside or falterings. Oh! our Sovereign, be attentive and
anxious, as though each hour of the day you carried a

<p class="p2" style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Enlighten me, Oh, Divine Reason! Spirits of my ancestors,
enter into my spirit, strengthen my weakness, embolden
my heart!&mdash;&mdash;Will these womanly hands have the power to
carry on high this sceptre, which is still too heavy for
the frail hands of my little son? At least they shall not
tremble! They shall hold it with an unrelaxing grasp, which
death alone will have the power to unlock. And you will aid
me, all of you, my faithful ones, you will aid me with your
advice, with your wisdom and your courage.</p>

<p>The name allotted by the Book of Centuries to the last
descendant of the Bright Dynasty is: Perfect Harmony
Realised. But alas! it seems a faraway dream, this harmony
announced in the ancient days of our history, and longed
for with many a prayer by our bruised hearts. Instead of
this dream of the future, we have the terrible present with
its uncertainty, instability, and war! And that Empire, of
which you have proclaimed me sovereign, we must reconquer
day by day, tearing it fragment by fragment from the grasp
of the ravisher.</p>

<p>Ah, how much bloodshed have we seen in the past three
centuries! It is a stream purple with blood, on which
floats the vessel freighted with our noble hopes! It tosses
about, it battles with the tempest, this vessel with the
reddened timbers, but it cannot suffer shipwreck, for
it stands for justice and right. Some day it shall drop
anchor in a peaceful port, the Bright Dynasty shall be
re-established for ever&mdash;and all our beloved dead, whose
bodies are scattered throughout the length and breadth of
the land, whose spirits abide in the clouds above, all our
unnumbered dead shall then have their magnificent revenge
and receive the reward of their martyrdom.</p>

<p>Like everyone of you here assembled, I dedicate my life
to that sacred cause; but it suffices not to die without
regret, we must fight to the last, we must defend ourselves
with our final breath, that our death may be fruitful. To
reconquer our country, to break the yoke which dishonours
it, let us make our hearts fearless, our souls implacable.
No pity nor mercy for the Tartar! May our heroic wrath
never lessen, nor our holy hate be appeased.</p>

<p>Toward all other living men we know our duties: good will,
compassion, charity. Whoever these men may be, whether they
come from the north or the south, or from the covetous
west, to all who shall call themselves our friends, let us
extend a brotherly hand in accordance with that immemorial
tradition, which only our invaders have violated.</p>

<p>I swear to you, oh, shades of my ancestors, and to you,
all my well beloved subjects, I swear to keep severe watch
upon myself, to take good care that I am not remiss in
any of my duties, I swear to be attentive and anxious, as
though I carried in my hands a chalice filled to the brim
with water, of which not one drop must be spilled. I swear
to hold my head high against the threats of the future, to
submit with resignation to cruel fate, and not even to move
an eye-lash if the sword be lifted against me.</p>

one of the first dignitaries of your Court, why am I so
insignificant a thing? Why is my will barren, when it
is so eager to make a path both smooth and glorious for
your feet? Oh! at my powerlessness to crush the menace of
fate, what a tumult of desire and righteous rage disturbs
my soul! And yet the celestial radiance of Your presence
illumines and inspires me. The dazzling light which
emanates from Your Majesty's presence seems to colour the
clouds on the far horizon, to pierce the shadows, and I
see You there, in the great city of the Tsings. I see you
seated and all powerful, on the very Throne of the <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR
EMPEROR</span>; the immense empire, undivided and at peace,
extending under your feet like a carpet of honour.</p>

<p>No! destiny cannot be cruel to you; before Your sacred
presence, its weapons will be dashed to pieces. Do not
the laws of Heaven and earth seem always to yield to
certain superior beings? Do you remember the beautiful
favourite, who formerly captivated one of your sovereign
ancestors? When the day arrived on which, having forfeited
the Imperial favour, she was given into the keeping of
the executioners, she gazed upon them calmly, and as
they brandished their swords against her, she smiled
sweetly&mdash;her only defence. Then they threw their weapons
at her feet, for no one had the courage to extinguish that
radiant smile&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> <i>and</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUR ATTENDANTS</span>.</p>


<p class="p2">[<i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> <i>comes out of the pavilion and advances
slowly to the edge of the terrace, her eyes raised to the
moon.</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUR ATTENDANTS</span> <i>follow her, but remain in the
background.</i>]</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>[<i>Halting at the top of the Imperial stair</i>] Oh, Night
of enchantment! Pure light and silence cool!&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
scintillating stars, envelope me in your rays! And thou,
pale moon, shroud me in thy blue light; calm my soul,
cool my fever! [<i>She commences her descent down the
"Imperial Stair," two of her attendants following, one by
the staircase on the right, the other by the staircase on
the left, regulating their steps according to those of
the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> <i>in the middle.</i>] That dream, that strange
dream which has aroused me from my sleep, I still feel
the terror of it&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Lowering her voice</i>] The terror and
the charm. [<i>To her attendants</i>] Let the astrologer be
called at once, that he may discover the meaning of this
dream and explain it without dissembling. Listen carefully
to my words. I was about to become the prey of a serpent
with shining scales,&mdash;already he was twining about me
and slowly choking me with his chilly coils. Fascinated
by his steady gaze, I had not the force to struggle;
enervated, inert, I surrendered myself, with no repugnance
against death. With fear and suffering a languor that was
almost a delight was mingled&mdash;&mdash;A supreme effort of the
will, however, extricated me from his grasp, and suddenly
aroused from sleep and dreams I found myself regretting
those deadly coils which had imprisoned me&mdash;&mdash;What can this
dream portend? [<i>To the women</i>] Report what I have told
you to the astrologer. Let him question the Unknown, and
give me his response here without delay. Go at once! [<i>Two
of the Attendants depart at this command. The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span>
<i>continues to descend slowly. She is alone in the middle
of the Imperial stair, which is very long, and whose white
surface seems sown with tiny glistering spangles.</i>] How
the dew sparkles on the marble footpath! It seems like a
carpet of stars. But as I walk I put out their light, and
my trailing gown changes the little glistening drops into
a pool of water, which soaks the hem of my robe. [<i>She
continues to descend.</i>] Why is there ever before my eyes
the image of that man whom I saw this morning for the
first time? Why, on this day, when so many heavy duties
have devolved upon my weakness, can I recall only that
deep and ardent gaze, which met mine with such sovereign
audacity? Why was I no more offended by that gaze than by
the rays of the kindly sun that beat upon my palace? He
found me beautiful, and his admiration for me shone like
an ornament more precious than the Imperial Phoenix of
my head-dress. How well I understood, when he prostrated
himself before me, with what feelings he threw himself at
my feet&mdash;&mdash;And my son exchanged glances of recognition with
him! How came he to know him? Why did I not even dare to
ask him, as though to speak of that man to my own child
were criminal? Oh, kindly powers of the night, spirits of
my deified ancestors who are about me in the air, august
shades to whom I have rendered homage in your golden
temples, come to my aid, gather about your unworthy and
feeble daughter! That man, that stranger in my path, on
such a day! Oh, divinities from whom I am descended, take
from my soul the very remembrance of him. In a solemn vow
I have renounced my earthly personality. Nothing of myself
belongs to me. Daughter of Heaven, Empress and Regent, I
am claimed entirely by my more than human mission&mdash;&mdash;Help
me to triumph over the weaknesses which were the charm of
life. Aid me to forget that there are flowers and pearls
and perfumes, grant that I may lose consciousness of the
fact that love is the only realm of woman, and beauty her
true power. May my breast from henceforth be only the
marble prison of my frozen heart! Should it revolt and
wish to beat again, may my will become its stern gaoler!
Aid me, oh, come down, pure spirits of the air! Make me as
unyielding as the goddesses of jade, who keep their eyes
lowered that they may not see the things of this world!</p>

<p>[<i>The attendants leave.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>That serpent which entwined me, Ah! that cannot be he. His
commanding gaze, riveted to mine, was noble and open. Why
should he appear to me in that hostile and terrible form?
No, no! in a soul that has eyes like that treachery cannot
flourish&mdash;&mdash;It cannot be he&mdash;&mdash;and yet I was carried away
by that icy embrace. Who else then, in the world could it
be?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Remain standing, noble old man. Your age and your sightless
eyes excuse you from formalities.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ASTROLOGER</p>

<p>My sightless eyes see into the invisible. My spirit,
meditating through so many days of darkness, is clairvoyant
and prophetic.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>How do you explain the mystery of that dream which obsesses
me?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ASTROLOGER</p>

<p>In the guise of a serpent, the dragon has come to the
phoenix to carry her off and to heap on her his treasures.
But the phoenix has not understood. He flapped his wings
and made his escape. Let her take shelter at present from
the terrible storm which, all unwillingly, the dragon
brings in his train.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>These words are more unfathomable than the dream.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ASTROLOGER</p>

<p>Yet thus the magic numbers have replied.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Can you not illumine the darkness?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ASTROLOGER</p>

<p>The veil which covers the future may not be torn away. To
raise one corner at the utmost is all that is allowed to us.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>And by that means should one not at least see a faint
glimmer?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ASTROLOGER</p>

<p>Take shelter from the terrible storm! Let the precious
torch which shall illumine the future be placed far beyond
the reach of the wind. That is the decree. There is nothing
more.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>It is well. I will meditate upon these enigmas. Go in
peace, noble old man.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ASTROLOGER</p>

<p>May propitious Heaven shower all its blessings on the
Bright Dynasty!</p>

<p class="p2">The <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>at the foot of the imperial stair, leaning on
the marble banisters.</i>] The storm, said the old man&mdash;&mdash;The
storm, it will come from the north as always!&mdash;&mdash;Black
clouds on the horizon, the armies which are marching
against my phantom empire. Black clouds, the armies of
the Tartar Emperor&mdash;&mdash;But this torch which shall illumine
the future, what it is? All! My son, it must be&mdash;&mdash;Ah,
yes, that it is; my son!&mdash;&mdash;To shelter him, he said, to
hide him, to send him far away, perhaps, from this palace
that is threatened on all sides; to separate myself from
him in this grave danger&mdash;that is what is now demanded of
me?&mdash;&mdash;Still more agony and sacrifice! And it is I who am
expected to guide a whole people, when I lack the force
to guide myself&mdash;&mdash;Oh you women who can lean on a strong
supporting arm, who can depend for help upon the advice
of a manly and farseeing mind! Oh you wives who find in
the heart of your husbands a refuge in your weakness!
But I am the Empress, and the widowed Empress, all alone
and so high that I have no equal to whom I may confide
my anxieties and my weaknesses&mdash;&mdash;[<i>She advances to the
middle of the flower-plot</i>] Come, listen to the confession
which is overpowering me, oh you flowers of early morning,
moist with fresh dew! Oh airy spirits which hover over
flower-beds at the dawn of springtime, hear me, since I
must speak and someone must listen. That man you know, who
came yesterday, whose gaze tyrannical and yet caressing
is like none other's, he has troubled the sad Empress's
heart, and now in the hour of great peril she is no longer
mistress of herself&mdash;&mdash;He is only one of her subjects, and
yet she would love to obey him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

ATTENDANTS.</span></p>


<p class="p2" style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE GRAND MISTRESS</p>

<p>[<i>Prostrating herself</i>] I have to inform your Majesty that
it is almost the hour of morn, fixed for the farewell
audiences.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>It is well. I come.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE GRAND MISTRESS</p>

<p>All is in readiness for the toilette of the Empress. What
are her orders?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>I shall give audience here, and let the wearisome ceremony
be made as simple as may be.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE GRAND MISTRESS</span> [<i>Still prostrating herself</i>]</p>

<p>My duties as Grand Mistress make it necessary for me to
call your Majesty's attention to the fact that this is
contrary to the rites. Audiences must take place in the
Throne Room, and be conducted in accordance with all the
rules of immemorial etiquette.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>We are above all rites and rules. I have spoken my will.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE GRAND MISTRESS</p>

<p>The orders of your Majesty shall be transmitted to the
officials of the palace, who will inform the princes and
the dignitaries.</p>

<p>It is well.</p>

well, oh, flowers of the morning, the secret which I have
confided to you. Now it has escaped from my soul! That
it may never return, lock it up, oh, flowers, in your
blossoms. [<i>She mounts several steps</i>] And you, ancestral
shades, to whom I make this last prayer, Oh! lend your
aid to your daughter, powerless to triumph over herself.
Make my heart invulnerable, since you have called me to
this sovereign mission. Give me the force to thrust aside
all but my noble duty. Oh, help me to remember only "the

<p>I know your merits and I realise what you deserve. But
believe me, true greatness is above titles. We are
devoting our lives to a noble cause, for the joy of seeing
it triumph, and not in the hope of a reward. If we die in
the service, our name will shine with a brightness, more
enduring I assure you, than that of a ruby in the crown of
your hat&mdash;&mdash;However, rest assured I shall do my utmost to
obtain it for you, since you aspire to it.</p>

<p>May I enquire after your precious health?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span> [<i>Bowing</i>]</p>

<p>How kind of you to trouble about so trifling a matter!
My health is good, thank you. I dare to hope that yours,
infinitely more precious, is also excellent to the joy of
us all.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</span> [<i>Bowing again</i>]</p>

<p>You see me overwhelmed by a solicitude of which I am
unworthy. Thank you, I am very well. Without excessive
pain I am reaching the allotted span&mdash;a poor thing, it is
true&mdash;of my days.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Did you succeed in seeing the representative of our
enemies, the Viceroy of Nanking?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</p>

<p>I saw him and I dictated a report, which he agreed to send
to Peking, but I have had to pay dearly for his discretion.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>If only we gain thereby a few days' respite, we shall not
need to regret the bait thrown into the mouth of the Tiger.
The treasures of the Mings, happily, are far from exhausted
and the secret vaults, all unknown to the Tartars, still
contain more than is necessary to defray the expenses of
war.</p>

<p>I once met the Governor of the South, but I must be
confusing him with someone else, for I recollect a person
very different from this one. Yet, if I had ever seen those

remained in my memory.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Indeed he has most uncommon expression and an extraordinary

<p>What makes you so uneasy?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT [<i>In a whisper</i>]</p>

<p>I am certain that I recognised here in the palace two
officers from Peking, disguised, like ourselves.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Yes? No doubt they were spies sent out in pursuit of me.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>I do not think so. More likely the leaders of a conspiracy,
against Nanking, perhaps to take it by surprise. We must
leave here as soon as possible. All is in readiness, the
horses are saddled, the vessel under steam&mdash;&mdash;You wished to
see this palace with your own eyes. You have succeeded, now
let us depart.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

Nothing could make me give up that happiness, which has
come to be for me the most desirable thing in the world.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>Every minute here we are risking our heads&mdash;&mdash;At least as
soon as you have had your audience, I beg you not to delay
another instant.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>You have my promise.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>The Faithful Prince has looked toward you several times and
you cannot do otherwise now than greet him. He is Prime
Minister and Commander-in-Chief, the most important person
here; a great heart and a fine character. His rank places
him above a viceroy.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>What shall I say to him?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>A few polite commonplaces.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Can I do so? [<i>He approaches the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span> <i>and
salutes him.</i>] Illustrious Prince, may a long and happy
life be yours! It is a blessing of Heaven to be permitted
to gaze upon your noble countenance and to meet the light
of your eyes.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span> [<i>Returning the bow</i>]</p>

<p>In truth I might say the same to you&mdash;&mdash;But I beg of you
let us dispense with compliments. Are you satisfied with
your government of the South?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>That region is the most faithfully rebellious of the
whole Empire, and is so far away that the orders for its
repression are lost before they reach it. The inhabitants
refuse to pay the tax levied by the Tartars and of their
own accord deposit the money in our coffers.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>You do not fail to accept only half of it, and to refuse it
altogether during bad years?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>I have done so, which accounts for our popularity.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to be near the throne, in order to
obtain a higher rank, more in accordance with your merits.
Make use of my influence to support your request&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>I am the slave of her Majesty, ready to serve her in any
position in which she may wish to employ me, but I ask for
nothing, and the good opinion which Your Excellence has of
my merits is to me the most acceptable recompense.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>I congratulate you on being without ambition and not fixing
a prize on your devotion&mdash;&mdash;Our Sovereign will appear soon.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR [<i>To</i> FOUNT]</p>

<p>Did I acquit myself creditably?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>In very dangerous words. Ah, how I wish I saw you safely
away from here!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</span> [<i>In a whisper to the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span>]</p>

<p>In truth, she is as beautiful as the pink peony.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Stopping on the last steps, between</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRINCES</span>]
There are some hours when nature appears more splendid,
the light of Heaven more radiant, when all things of the
world seem transfigured and new, and the soul then expands
in the joy of living&mdash;&mdash;Oh, my faithful ones despite our
threatening to-morrows, the present is for your Sovereign
one of those rare hours. [<i>In an aside</i>] It seems as though
I had suddenly become two personalities, a new rapture and
unknown hopes fill my bewildered heart.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR [<i>To</i> FOUNT]</p>

glorious hour I knew not what it meant to live&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>You desired the government of the fortress of Tang-Men. The

with it.</p>

<p>[<i>Bending the knee</i>] I shall redouble my zeal to be worthy
of such an honour.</p>

<p>Do so. [<i>She passes on, while</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GRAND EQUERRY</span> <i>places a

<p>The Emperor appoints you to that higher rank which you have
so deservedly earned.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE OFFICER</p>

<p>My life belongs to your Majesties, and my sole desire is to
be able to sacrifice it in a good cause.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Keep it for our service.</p>

<p>[<i>A yellow scroll is given to the officer</i>]</p>

to name the favour which would please you?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">POPLAR</p>

<p>Nay, I ask one of Heaven, one only, that it will stay the

<p>A <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GRAND SECRETARY</span> [<i>In a whisper to a</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">COUNCILLOR</span>] With one

<p>He is the favourite of to-morrow. We shall have to reckon
with him.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>You gave my son a jewel marvellously cut, a dragon, emblem
of the Imperial Power. He is delighted with it, and wishes
me to offer you in his name, the emblem of the Empresses, a
phoenix, with wings of sapphires and rubies.</p>

<p>Golden Lotus, did you, as I command, attach a ring on which
to hang it?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOLDEN LOTUS</p>

<p>Yes, Your Majesty.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Until to-day I had seen but the nests of ordinary birds,
and I did not believe in that incomparable bird the
Phoenix. It is only to-day that its existence was disclosed
to me by the evidence of my enchanted eyes. [<i>He hangs the
jewel on his belt.</i>]</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Alas, the phoenix and the dragon are dragged down by chains
to-day, and cannot reach the heights to which they aspire
in the clouds.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Ah, how ardently I wish I were the Tartar Emperor reigning
at Peking!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>What a strange and dismal idea! You wish you were my mortal
enemy? Why?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>That I might attempt to set all China at your feet, to
bring to you your own, and then to be your most faithful
subject.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Smiling</i>]</p>

<p>What a dream!&mdash;&mdash;But from that Emperor I could accept
nothing&mdash;&mdash;nothing, but death. Do not desire to be anyone
else than you are for no one has ever inspired in me
so sudden and deep a sympathy. Do not leave the palace
yet&mdash;&mdash;Await my commands. Since you have no ambition I must
have it in your place, and keep you perhaps more near to
me&mdash;&mdash;Farewell until we meet!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>Rising and bowing</i>]</p>

<p>Divine Sovereign, two Tartar spies entered the palace with
the monstrous design of kidnapping our young Emperor. Like
tigers they lay in wait, hidden in the bushes. They came
out all unawares and dared to lay a hand on the sacred
person of your son.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE CHILD</p>

<p>Mother they threw a cloth over my head and tightened it
round my throat.</p>

<p>Who are you?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIRST SPY</p>

<p>Faithful servants of the dynasty of the Tsing.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</p>

<p>Where do you come from?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND SPY</p>

<p>From the only capital of our great and pure Empire.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</p>

<p>Your crime is flagrant and needs no further proof, what
have you to say?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIRST SPY</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND SPY</p>

<p>Yes! We wished to kidnap the child, to hold him as a
hostage and thus to have you at our mercy. We have nothing
further to say. Our lips are sealed.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</p>

<p>Name your accomplices.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND SPY</p>

<p>We shall say nothing.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</p>

<p>Ha! ha! We have made others speak. [<i>To the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span>] The
torture at once, is it not?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span> [<i>To the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span>]</p>

<p>I venture to suggest to your Majesty that it might be
better perhaps to imprison these men in a dungeon. We do
not know who they are, nor of how great importance in the
eyes of the enemy. What secrets might we not indeed extract
from these two!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>What! After what they have done, you would have them see
the light of another day?&mdash;&mdash;remember that they have
dared to lay a hand on the sacred person of him in whom
lives all our hope; they have bruised his neck, frail as a
stem of a flower. To kidnap him as hostage, they said! How
do I know that they did not rather mean to kill my child.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">ALL</p>

<p>Death! Death!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

dogs. At once!</p>

<p>Oh, my best beloved! Oh, you, who bear the sweet name of
Son of Springtime, how near was I to losing you!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE CHILD</p>

<p>Tell me, mother are those men to be put to death?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>That is the lightest punishment which their crime deserves.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE CHILD</p>

<p>No, it is too much, as they did not kill me.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>But they desired your death. The sentence is too lenient.
And see, I spared them the torture-chamber&mdash;&mdash;Now, I shall
never again dare to be away from you. No, not even for a
minute, my priceless jewel, shall you again be out of my
sight.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>My Sovereign, how it pains me to be forced to tear your
heart by telling you what we believe to be your painful
duty, we to whose advice your Majesty deigns to listen.
For many days, we have been resolved to speak, and yet we
shrank from the ungrateful task. But to-day the danger is
too pressing.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Oh, what are you going to say? [<i>She descends from her
throne.</i>]</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Alas, that my words shall be like the cold north wind which
kills the flowers.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>I already feel the chill in my very soul.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>You must for a time be separated from your son.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>[<i>With drooping head</i>] I knew too well!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>The hope of all, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE VICTORY</span> to come, our Young
Emperor!&mdash;He should be protected from the dangers of war,
in safety, far from here, in some inaccessible province.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>"Let the precious torch which shall illumine the future
be placed beyond the reach of the wind." Thus spoke the
astrologer. Yes, the blind man did see into the invisible.
Thus is the mystery of his words explained&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>We must obey the oracle. Misfortune foreseen can often
be avoided. Winged Prince, and you Veiled-Light, sage
councillors, does your opinion coincide with mine.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</p>

<p>It is the same in every point.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>And all you, noble chiefs, wise men of letters,
dignitaries, are you too of the opinion that we must send
the young Emperor away. [<i>All nod their heads affirmatively
without speaking.</i>] And not to-morrow, not even this
evening alas&mdash;for each moment the danger increases&mdash;&mdash;We
must act at once, if your Majesty consents to the sacrifice.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Oh! You place me in a circle of fire, which you narrow
again and again, far too quickly. But where are the Tartar
armies, now? Not yet beneath our walls, surely. We are not
besieged! The roads are still open&mdash;&mdash;[<i>She presses her son
to her breast.</i>] Leave him with me just another day, at
least give me time to find the necessary strength to bear
this new affliction&mdash;&mdash;I am the Empress, yes, but I am
also a mother&mdash;&mdash;One does not take a child from its mother
as one plucks a flower from its stem&mdash;&mdash;Wait!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Wait, my Sovereign! But will not your despair be infinitely
more intense should harm come to his Majesty because of
a weak tenderness? Think of the turmoil of a siege, the
horror and the risk of battle! Let us thank Heaven for
giving us time to place our young Master in safety. As soon
as the danger is over, he will return to you.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Oh, do not speak of return to lessen my distress, as you
would comfort a child!&mdash;&mdash;Let us not talk of the future,
which is black and cloudy&mdash;&mdash;But Wisdom has spoken, and
my rebellion is over. I shall have the strength to submit.
[<i>To the child, whom she holds still pressed close against
her.</i>] My son, you must go away from me for a little
while&mdash;&mdash;Ah, tears fill my eyes at the idea. But when I
think of keeping you in this palace, in the midst of such
terrible dangers, anguish crushes my heart&mdash;&mdash;My best
beloved, you must go.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE CHILD</span> [<i>Embracing her</i>]</p>

<p>What? I must go on account of the Tartars? Well, I am not
afraid, I am not really. Do you think that I am afraid?
You remain here, my mother, and where you remain there I
must be too.&mdash;&mdash;Leave my mother on account of the Tartars?
I do not want to! You all hear me. I do not want to.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>My son! You will show greater courage in saying good-bye to
me. And you must prove yourself worthy of your noble, your
more than human lot. Remember that you are not an ordinary
child. Under your delicate flesh, in the fine network of
your veins, flows the blood of divinity. The Bright Dynasty
has no representative but you alone. Oh, my best beloved!
You are the son of Heaven!</p>

<p>[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE CHILD</span>, <i>very thoughtful, lets his head sink</i>]</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Raise up your face, do not turn it down, dazzled by the
bright name of your ancestors. Already you must be master
of your feelings. You owe your heart as a debt to this
people unnumbered, which is conquered and oppressed and
looks to you for its deliverance. To this people alone
belong your thoughts, your actions, your very life.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE CHILD</span> [<i>Sad and grave</i>]</p>

<p>I will go&mdash;&mdash;I will not cry.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>To whom shall we entrust this greatest of our treasures?
You have no doubt thought about it. I feel that your plans
are made.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Our young Emperor has shown without knowing him, a sympathy
for the Viceroy of the South. Now he is precisely the best
situated to offer him an inviolable refuge. My advice is
that we entrust him to him.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS [<i>To</i> THE CHILD]</p>

<p>Will that please you?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE CHILD</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>It was also my idea. The Viceroy is certainly still at the
palace awaiting my orders. [<i>To</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</span>] Call him

<p class="p2" style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE [<i>To</i> FAITHFUL PRINCE.]</p>

<p>A courier has just arrived and brings strange news.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>What is it now?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</p>

<p>The Viceroy of the South sends to explain to your Majesty
that the reason that he was unable to reach the palace for
the ceremony to which he was invited was because he was
taken prisoner at the moment when he was about to enter
Nanking.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>But the Viceroy came here!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</p>

<p>That was not the real Viceroy.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Not the real Viceroy?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</p>

<p>He was imprisoned on a ship, but no harm came to him, and
he was treated with every consideration&mdash;&mdash;His letter
explains how he escaped.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Treated with every consideration! What does that imply? The
spies of the Tsings are less generous.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</p>

<p>The Viceroy sent this courier in all haste; he awaits
orders to come and prostrate himself at the foot of the
throne and sue for pardon.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Then that man who was here?&mdash;&mdash;Oh, in what frightful web
are we now caught?&mdash;&mdash;And I was about to entrust my son to
that unknown man!&mdash;&mdash;I ordered him to remain here. Run,
perhaps he has not yet gone.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</span> [<i>Returning</i>]</p>

<p>The pavilion is empty. This silk scroll was placed so as to
attract immediate attention.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]</p>

<p>Give it to me!&mdash;&mdash;[<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ARROW-BEARER</span> <i>gives the scroll to</i>
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span>, <i>who gives it to the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span>. <i>Aside.</i>]
In my dream&mdash;&mdash;The serpent that coiled about me&mdash;&mdash;Ah!
It was he! [<i>She steps aside to read.</i>] Verses!&mdash;&mdash;In my
trouble, I shall scarce be able to read them. And then the
meaning seems so mysterious. [<i>To</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE OFFICERS</span> <i>standing
nearest to her.</i>] Let twenty horsemen be sent out at once
in all directions, pursue him. Let the neighbouring towns
be searched as well. A hundred thousand taels to him who
brings that man back to me. Go!&mdash;&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span>
<i>handing him the silken scroll.</i>] Read it to me Faithful
Prince.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span> [<i>reading</i>]</p>

<p>
Beneath my mask I kept a secret watch on you.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You saw my face, but not my features true;</span><br />
You heard my words, but not my secret heart.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The day will come when I shall throw away the mask,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Play your good angel's part,</span><br />
And all shall bow beneath the conquering dragon's task.<br />

<p>The traitor is a fine scholar, but he does not unmask his
identity.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</span> [<i>To</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE CHILD</span>]</p>

<p>Your Majesty must no longer keep about your neck like a
relic a present given you by an impostor.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE CHILD</span> [<i>Excitedly</i>]</p>

<p>But I will keep it. I thought of my dead father when I saw
that man, and when he told me that he would like to have me
for a son, he was keeping back his tears.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>The instinct of children does not mislead them&mdash;&mdash;nor
can I believe, either, that the unknown visitor meant us
harm&mdash;&mdash;Let us wait awhile before we begin to hate him.</p>

<p>Yes, but to whom will you now entrust your Emperor? Let
us take time to think at least&mdash;&mdash;Or perhaps, since there
is such immediate need, you have deceived me, and we are
surrounded? Where is the Tartar army? I am not an idol shut
up in a shrine. Let me be told the truth!&mdash;&mdash;Where is this
army?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Very near and in great force&mdash;&mdash;The messengers will bring
us details this evening&mdash;&mdash;In order not to cloud the
brow of your Majesty during the glorious days of your
investiture we have deceived you it is true. Forgive us!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>I understand&mdash;&mdash;but now my son, to whom is he to be
entrusted?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Still to the Viceroy of the South, to the real, one we
may trust him. His devotion of ten years has stood all
tests. So we must now march to meet him, and without
losing an hour he must re-trace his steps toward Yunnan
with his precious charge. To this end the start must
be made instantly, so that the two escorts may meet
before nightfall. [<i>To</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</span>] Prince, until
further orders, remain with the Emperor. Keep up constant
communication with the frontier, and on the first alarm
take the child out of the Empire.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>And every day a courier must bring me news, as long as the
roads are free about our walls and our gates are open.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">WINGED PRINCE</p>

<p>I shall attend to all, relying on none other than myself.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>And we all know the value of your watchfulness.</p>

<p>What is it now?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>A small body of Tartars has boldly come unarmed to the
very foot of the walls. One of them, whose manner is calm
and noble, says that he has been sent by the Emperor with
a last communication to your Majesty. He showed us, under
the light of a torch which we lit, the Imperial seal of the
Tsings, of a scroll of yellow silk.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>A communication? From the usurper to your Sovereign, a
communication? Is not the very idea an insult? Let these
bold men go away unharmed, but tell them to go at once.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>To have seen him. Where?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>[<i>Coming nearer and lowering his voice</i>] My sovereign,
I think&mdash;&mdash;that unknown, who came the day of the
investiture&mdash;&mdash;I am sure of it&mdash;It is he!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>[<i>Arising bewildered</i>] Why do you whisper?&mdash;&mdash;Prince,
you almost insult me with that tone of confidence, when
it concerns that man. You mean him who presented himself
fraudulently as our Viceroy of the South?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Very well then, have him brought here. Throw the
rope-ladder to him that he may appear before me. [<i>The
ladder is thrown from the top of the wall.</i>]</p>

<p>Hide the poison, Cinnamon, and the golden flask as well. He
who is coming need not know.... Has the fire darkened my
face?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Trembling</i>]</p>

<p>Oh, dispense with all vain formalities. The minutes
left to us are sparingly numbered&mdash;&mdash;Drop the mask and
speak quickly. Who are you? A Tartar, alas! are you not?
Otherwise you would have been unable to break through their
ring of steel&mdash;&mdash;A Tartar, say?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>A spy, then, when you came on my Coronation day? Nothing
but a spy, alas!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>No! One who risked his life that day, as he does again, to
save yours.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>My life is no longer of any importance, and the right to
save it belongs to none. At the Court of the Usurper who
reigns at Peking what position is I yours?&mdash;&mdash;Secret agent
for venturesome missions? No, a great dignitary, then? Tell
me.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>And a Prince?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

concern. Deign to listen to what the Emperor&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Interrupting</i>]</p>

<p>Where is your Emperor? At the head of his troops?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>Embarrassed</i>]</p>

<p>Well&mdash;&mdash;No, in his place over yonder. The rites, I need
scarcely tell you, do not permit him to leave it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Throughout this dialogue the cannon is heard
incessantly in distant parts of the city.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>The rites, ah, the rites! You see what attention I have
paid to the rites, I, the daughter of the Mings, the
daughter of Heaven and the Invisible&mdash;&mdash;I am here in the
midst of my soldiers. I am fighting like them!&mdash;&mdash;And it is
he, your phantom Emperor, who dares to send me a message?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>With a message of pardon one always dares&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Say rather that a message of pardon is the last message
which may be sent when it is from him and concerns
me!&mdash;&mdash;So the Tartars dare to offer pardon!&mdash;&mdash;You have
just passed through my city of Nanking and you have seen?
It is glorious, is it not, their work?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Alas! yes, I have seen with horror,&mdash;&mdash;but I can swear to
you by my life that such were not the orders which were
given by my Sovereign.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Ah! a Sovereign then, who has not the force wherewith
to command obedience!&mdash;&mdash;So others have told me that
before&mdash;&mdash;I still hate him with that ineradicable
race-hatred which you know, to which now contempt is
added. Oh, that Emperor who smokes opium in his mummy's
palace, while his hordes of soldiers at their own free will
go through the provinces, leaving red tracks behind and
charnel-houses for the vultures!</p>

<p>And if the impossible were to happen and I were to
humiliate myself sufficiently to accept his pardon, who
would warrant me after all&mdash;since he is not obeyed? Amid
that army of wild beasts which was here awhile ago and will
return soon to shout for our death, who could enforce the
order of pardon of your phantom Emperor?&mdash;&mdash;Who, I ask?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>I!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>You! [<i>More gently and in some agitation.</i>] You! Perhaps in
very truth you might, for you seem to be one of those whom
one dare not disobey. Moreover you have the superb audacity
to reappear at this moment! But if the loyalty which I read
in your eyes does not deceive me, cease the game which you
are playing, and this time answer&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Who are you?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Who am I? Up to now nothing! Inexistent as a vaporous
cloud! Nothing! But to-morrow perhaps everything, if you so
wish it. To-morrow everything and radiating at your side
like a sun in the blue ether&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Drawing back</i>]</p>

<p>Ah, you remember all too well my recent indulgence toward
your enigmas. Amid the perfume of incense, amid pomp and
luxury, I betrayed the weakness of a woman. To-day, no; you
find me stronger and more stern, precisely because I am
defeated, and know that I must die.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>Bowing before her</i>]</p>

<p>Oh, Sovereign, never were you more sacred to me Do not be
offended by my words and for a short time still allow me my
mask and my mystery. Hear only this: A fortnight ago, when
I left that palace where I saw you in all your Imperial
splendour, I hastened to Peking to request of that Emperor
whom you hate that he would stop this horrible war. On the
way I learned that our Tartar armies were marching with
lightning speed, and I turned back as quick as my ship and
horses could take me, to give to them myself the order for
peace. I have the right to do so. See, here is the seal
which gives me full power in the name of Tsings. As you
have said, I am one of those whom men dare not disobey; at
least, not face to face, when I speak&mdash;&mdash;I have learned now
how to give orders and to enforce them. Deign only to allow
your soldiers to give the signal for a truce, just to hoist
the flag on the tower, and not one of their heads shall
fall, I swear it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>To make that offer to me, Prince, you must not be of the
Imperial blood&mdash;&mdash;The Daughter of Heaven can never accept
the mercy of a Tartar!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>My task, you say, is not yet completed? But the palace
is only a ruin. The gates are giving way, the walls are
crumbling&mdash;&mdash;This time we can withstand the attack only ten
minutes&mdash;&mdash;it is the end!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Alas, I know it all too well. There is no hope.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Then let me go&mdash;&mdash;the Tartars are returning. Listen, I too
begin to hear their war-trumpets. You would not have that
they should take your Empress alive, or even find her body
to throw to the crows.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Hear me, I entreat you!&mdash;&mdash;[<i>He motions to</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">VEILED-LIGHT</span>,
<i>who has just appeared at the back. The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> <i>has set
down the cup on a stone.</i>] We have deferred making known to
you the last heroic service which we purpose to demand&mdash;&mdash;Permit
your Councillor to convey to you our unanimous
opinion.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">VEILED-LIGHT</span> [<i>Bending the knee</i>]</p>

<p>Oh, Majesty, 200,000 soldiers have died for you. The few
hundred, also, who remain here within our walls, are about
to sacrifice their lives at once. Do you wish them to
die for a lost cause. [<i>He motions to the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">CHIEF</span> <i>of the
Soldiers to approach.</i>] Deign to permit their chief to add
his prayers to ours.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">CAPTAIN</span> <i>of the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SOLDIERS</span>, [<i>After bending the knee.</i>]</p>

<p>Proudly and without regret we give up our lives for our
Sovereign&mdash;&mdash;May she too do what we have learned to expect
of her marvellous courage, a thousand times greater than
that of her humble defenders.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">VEILED-LIGHT</p>

<p>Oh, Majesty, we must envy these men who are about to die so
gloriously. Our duty is otherwise; it is longer, it is more
terrible.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Our duty longer and more terrible?&mdash;&mdash;Then what do you
expect of me? Speak, what would you say. Your Empress will
obey you, but speak at once, I do not understand. [<i>She
takes again the golden cup.</i>]</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>What we must do, my beloved Sovereign, is to flee and live.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS [<i>Violently</i>]</p>

<p>Ah, no! All that you have demanded of me I have done, but I
refuse to take flight like a coward.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">VEILED-LIGHT</p>

<p>To flee, alas! yes. But to escape from the enemy, to
deprive them of the prize of war&mdash;&mdash;and thus their success
will be but failure. Soon the blood of our heroes will
inspire other heroes. A new army will rally to the cause of
the Daughter of Heaven, and the war will begin again.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>And more blood will be spilt&mdash;&mdash;and the ravaged country
will people the realm of the shades&mdash;&mdash;No, no, enough of
death's&mdash;&mdash;I fear to have my reign handed down as that of
a fatal and murderous Sovereign. All this blood! All this
blood spilled for me! It seems to me that my very hands are
red with it!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>The blood of your subjects is inexhaustible, and their
devotion is limitless.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Suddenly becoming very calm and as though
beseeching</i>]</p>

<p>But my courage is exhausted. [<i>Pointing to the Soldiers,
who are piling wood upon the fire.</i>] I want to die with
them.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Live, that their death may not have been in vain. Live to
bring back our young Emperor, whom the Army of the South is
protecting for us. Live for us all and for him.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>My son! Oh, speak not that name. Do not, to influence me,
do not try to touch upon that string, that alone I forbid
you touch. At the very moment when you tore him from me,
I had an intuition that I should never see him again,
never again gaze upon his dear little face, his beautiful
eyes&mdash;&mdash;I have courage to listen to all except when you
speak to me of him,&mdash;&mdash;for then, do you not see, I become
again a mother, nothing but a mother, like other women,
and I have no longer, no longer the strength.&mdash;&mdash;[<i>She turns
her head and begins to sob.</i>] Oh, not to belong to one's
self, not even to be allowed to lay down on the roadside
the burden of one's life!&mdash;&mdash;To be the impersonal idol of
a whole people, to be dealt with in accordance with their
will! To be a wretched fetish, whom all watch as carefully
as the tablets of their ancestors on the family altar!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>You are the shining standard, the ever-radiant goddess,
toward whom we turn in our supreme distress&mdash;&mdash;and you will
do what millions of your subjects demand of you, through
the mouths of these few brave men who are about to die.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE WATCHMAN</span> [<i>from the height of the turret,</i>] He hurls
himself against their vanguard, the man who was here just
now, the Messenger of peace&mdash;&mdash;with the three others who
accompanied him. He hurls himself against their vanguard
as though to make them halt. Yes, he wishes them to stop,
that is it. And he seems to command like a master, and to
inspire them with fear.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>To the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">WATCHMAN</span>]</p>

<p>So! Let not that man's name be mentioned again to me. And
you, poor Watchman, whose task is finished, you may come
down and join your brothers in arms, to die with them. Of
what concern to us now are the movements of the Tartars?
We are no longer of this world. [<i>To</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span>] But
how, then, is what you asked of me possible?&mdash;&mdash;Surrounded
on all sides, how and whither can we flee. Where can we
hide? Where?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SOLDIERS</span>, <i>having loosened the rock, are
standing in front of the bronze door, still
holding their crowbars and pickaxes. They have
an air of expectancy.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>There in the tomb. On the cement lying all ready now to
seal the rocks we shall throw dust&mdash;&mdash;as soon you shall
have entered.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>After a silence, speaking slowly, submissive
and very melancholy</i>] In my grave entombed alive! Be it so!
And after that?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>There is a subterranean passage, which passes through the
vaults where your father and your husband sleep. You know,
as I do, that its end opens out upon brushwood in the
country, at the foot of the Hill of Tortures.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>[<i>Quickly and breathlessly</i>] If it is not already
obstructed by the soil, yes! And all about the Hill of
Tortures the Tartars are encamped.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>We will wait until they are no longer there.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>And shall we have sufficient air in this vault, where sleep
our dead?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Yes, I believe so&mdash;&mdash;but let us take this potion with us
which you wished to drink a while ago.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Very excitedly</i>]</p>

<p>And if the Tartars take us there, if they track us like
beasts of the night, hunted into their burrows? Remember
how they violated the tomb of my ancestor.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>It was not secret, like yours.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Still in great excitement</i>]</p>

<p>And, clothes wherewith to escape through the country where
the enemy roams at large? [<i>Pointing to her uniform.</i>] Not
these, for sure?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Some taken from the enemy will serve admirably&mdash;&mdash;The
ground must be covered with them.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Rags torn from some festering corpse, is it thus you
would clothe your Empress!&mdash;&mdash;So be it, even to that I
consent&mdash;&mdash;But how can we live in the depths of that tomb?
Since we are not yet of the Shades, we must eat, you know
that. I divided my last grains of rice this morning with
you and my soldiers!&mdash;&mdash;What then?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span> [<i>Pointing to the tomb.</i>]</p>

<p>The consecrated cakes there on the table of the dead.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Horror and sacrilege!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">VEILED-LIGHT</p>

<p>There is no sacrilege, when the safety of the Bright
Dynasty is at stake. The August Shades will come in person
to invite us to eat. Our sacrifice will make them indulgent
and favourable.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS [<i>Slowly</i>]</p>

<p>And so I must be the one to live in the chill gloom with
no certainty of ever coming forth. I must be the one to
creep about like a ghost in the vaults peopled by phantoms,
groping my hands over the pious offerings shrivelling on
the altars of the dead&mdash;&mdash;Aye, it is indeed more terrible
than dying here. But I accept it. Lead me on, I am resigned.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE WATCHMAN</span> [<i>From the top of the wall</i>]</p>

<p>The Tartars have stopped their march, a small group is
running toward us, unarmed, but carrying signs on long
poles. In spite of the darkness, it looks like a message
which grants pardon.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Ha, a forced pardon&mdash;&mdash;that would be more insulting still.
Bury me in my tomb, Prince, before they come.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span> [<i>Pointing to</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">VEILED-LIGHT</span>]</p>

<p>Your Councillor and I will follow you into the tomb, and
perhaps two of these young girls if they feel brave enough
for the ordeal.</p>

that they ask I will give.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>You desired to know why they were piling so much wood on

that they make, that you will set the torch to their
funeral pile.</p>

My well beloved soldiers, be assured that your Empress will
soon follow you into the land of the Shades. She accepts
your request that she should flee, only that she may try
to avenge you. But if happier days smile upon the Bright
Dynasty she will refuse to live them. Before you all, she
takes this solemn vow; When once her relentless task is
at an end, she will hasten to join you in the land of the
Shades&mdash;&mdash;Oh, victims that are more than men, oh, conquered
ones that wear the halo of glory! Oh, my heroic army!&mdash;&mdash;A
day shall come when the story of your sublime death shall
be engraved in letters of gold on the Imperial Jade, that
posterity may weep for you. [<i>She sets the torch to the

grey wall with battlements, occupies the back of the stage,
and, on the left, disappears from view in the distance.
Chinese prisoners are attached to stakes all along the
wall, others are in the cangue, under a huge red signboard.
Here and there decapitated heads hang dripping from spikes.
There are bloodstains all over the ground. A noisy crowd
hurries along the front of the scene. The men wearing
modern Peking costume, long queues, blue cotton robes and
goat-skin tunics. The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR</span> <i>women, of lower-class,

foreground are wiping the dripping blades of their swords.</i>]</p>

<p>[<i>To some other women as he points to the prisoners tied

<p>Oh, I'm not one of those who take pleasure in seeing heads
cut off&mdash;&mdash;and, besides, the sight is always the same. No,
it is their goddess whom I wish to see.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND TARTAR WOMAN.</p>

<p>Their goddess?&mdash;&mdash;their Empress?&mdash;&mdash;Ah, and so do I. All of
us want to see their goddess. She is the one who interests
us the most.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THIRD TARTAR WOMAN</p>

<p>And do you suppose they will show her to you?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND WOMAN</p>

<p>Why not? They are showing us all their generals and
princes, and all the rest of them&mdash;&mdash;Prisoners are made to
be seen, that is why they were brought here to Peking.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THIRD WOMAN</p>

<p>Oh, yes, but she&mdash;&mdash;it seems that while she was being
brought here, she was treated with every consideration
that could be shown to a queen. And the Emperor has had her
placed in the Forbidden City, you know; in his very Palace
indeed.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND WOMAN</p>

<p>It is said that her eyes are so wonderful that ordinary
people like us cannot meet their gaze.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">JASMINE-FLOWER</p>

<p>Yes, and I should be afraid to look at her! A woman who has
been dead&mdash;for she was dead for at least two moons, you
know!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">SECOND WOMAN</p>

<p>Jasmine Flower believes everything that is told her.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">JASMINE</p>

<p>Why, every one knows that she was dead&mdash;&mdash;For two moons, I
tell you! She spent two moons in her grave.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FRUIT-VENDOR</p>

<p>Ay, ay, white as tallow, white as jade, new melon!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIRST WOMAN</p>

<p>It is well known that bullets and grapeshot passed through
her as through a ghost. [<i>Seeing a</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">CAPTAIN</span> <i>of the</i>

who was there when she was taken. Isn't it true,
Lee-Phuang?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">LEE-PHUANG</p>

<p>Oh, yes, I was a witness myself. The bullets could not
touch this goddess of theirs!</p>

<p class="p2"><i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</span> [<i>coming out of his tent and
saluting</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span>, <i>who brings up the rear of the
last group of condemned men.</i>]</p>

<p>Enter here, noble captive. Look not over yonder. Each man
should die but once, and you would die each time you saw a
head fall. Is it not punishment enough for you to be the
last of all the victims?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Perhaps my presence may strengthen my poor soldiers, so
simple in their heroism.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>No, no, your suffering only adds to their pain&mdash;&mdash;Grant a
loyal enemy the great honour of passing the last minutes of
your glorious life in his tent. You are now above worldly
trivialities and implacable hates.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>The sword is not responsible, not even the executioner.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>Nor yet even the General!</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>And I make no boast. I know that the sages disapprove of
war and hold that the work of the conqueror amounts to no
more than the dust of ten thousand skeletons&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>And that those who triumph deserve no more than the honour
of a funeral.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>Yes, the glory of arms is indeed but the smoke of a fire!
[<i>They seat themselves on camp-stools, and rice wine
is served to them. Throughout the following dialogue
executions are in progress in the foreground, amid
the shouts of the crowd. Every minute the sword of an
executioner describes a circle in the air, and as each head
falls, it is hung up on the great wall of Peking. Deafening
shrieks and cries accompany the conversation of the two men
in the tent.</i>]</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>Before passing from this world, have you not some mission
for your dear ones which you might desire carried out? I
would undertake it respectfully.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Beyond a doubt all who were dear to me have perished. I
thank you for your considerate offer.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>Have you no last desire?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>One only. To know the fate of our Empress. She was fighting
too in that dreadful battle where I was taken prisoner. Is
she alive or dead, free or captive?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>She is living, a captive only a fortnight since, and
yesterday was brought to Peking, not far from here in the
Forbidden City.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>She is not far from here, my Sovereign! Ah, if only the
gods, wearied with afflicting us, would permit&mdash;&mdash;To know
that she is so near!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>At the end of that battle which was so great an honour to
the defeated, she succeeded in escaping with a thousand
soldiers. But her retreat was cut off, and the Warrior
Empress would have been captured long before had not
contradictory orders hindering our movements, enabled
her to delay her capture from day to day. You would have
thought someone in great authority was watching over her
with wonderful solicitude, warning her of dangers or
endeavouring to turn them aside from her.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>May he live long happy days, and may his fame be
imperishable!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>Oh, when will this dreadful war cease, which is renewed and
has already soaked the soil of our country in the blood of
her sons?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>I fear it will never end until one of the two races has
been exterminated&mdash;&mdash;Yet perhaps the hatred would be less
intense if the conquerors after their victory would treat
the defeated with more clemency. Let there not be so many
executions, so much bloodshed. Each soldier who can no
longer defend his life should be sacred.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>Pardon was offered to your soldiers if they would yield.
All refused.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Their heroism should be only an additional reason for
sparing them.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>What can be done? Our duty is to obey.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>Not to the extent of a crime. A little stone can ofttimes
retard the course of a heavy chariot. We, the chieftains,
by sacrificing only our own lives could thereby save the
crowds.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">TARTAR GENERAL</p>

<p>How could that be?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</p>

<p>By opposing unrighteousness. Do you remember? There was
once another war similar in every way to this. The city
was sacked, the command was given to the executioners to
cut off all heads as now. But a young officer, maddened by
grief at the thought of such carnage, found words wherewith
to beseech the general to be merciful, or at least to
restrict the number of executions, with the result that
he consented to limit the massacre to the length of time
which is required to burn a stick of incense. The incense
was lighted and the first head was about to fall, when the
young officer trembling with horror seized the stick,
reduced it to powder and ran to the executioner, crying
aloud "It is finished, it is finished. Pardon has been
declared." Then, since he had disobeyed, he immediately
dashed his head against a rock. The people erected a temple
in memory of this hero, which is still to be seen on a
high hill and whose steps have for many centuries been
constantly covered with fresh flowers.</p>

this accursed place. All around the mighty Dragon who has
freed you, wild beasts are shrieking, exasperated because
they have lost their prey.&mdash;&mdash;Go at once, do not lose a
moment. But do not escape by way of the country, you would
be too easily found. Disperse and wander through the great
city. In the Chinese Quarter the crowd will not betray you.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">PRISONERS</p>

<p>We will follow your advice. May Heaven bestow its choicest
blessings upon you!</p>

<p>[<i>The great throne-room in the palace at Peking, entirely
decorated in red and gold. The throne is in the middle
of a dais, to which lead three staircases flanked by
incense-burners and emblems. Pillars of red laquer support
a lofty ceiling, on which are enormous writhing dragons
among red clouds; the largest standing out so clearly that
it looks ready to fall from heaven, holds in its jaws a
golden orb, just above the throne. The floor is covered
by a yellow carpet, with dragons more than fifty feet in
length woven into the design. On one side of the stage is a
marble chime, suspended by golden chains from a huge frame
work, whose feet are of gold and represent monsters and
whose upper angles are ornamented with golden phoenixes
spreading their wings toward the ceiling. Near the
principal entrance two</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EUNUCHS</span> <i>are holding dust-dispellers
of rhinoceros-hide. Preparations are being made for a
solemn audience, to commemorate the triumph of the</i> TARTAR
ARMY. <i>Large blocks of porcelain, representing monsters,
are arranged in line on the carpet. They mark the places
where the various bodies of dignitaries are to stand and
to prostrate themselves. Persons in gala robes come and
go hurriedly. They are speaking in whispers, and walk
noiselessly, in respectful attitudes. They bow as they pass
the throne.</i>]</p>

<p>Everything seems to me in perfect order. We shall soon be
ready.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">AN OFFICIAL</p>

<p>So they say, indeed. He has been downcast and melancholy
for several days, it seems as though each fresh victory of
his army affected him like a disaster.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THIRD OFFICER</p>

<p>Yes, no one would have supposed that he would demand so
elaborate a ceremony to celebrate his triumph.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOURTH OFFICER</p>

<p>And have you heard the news? The prisoner is to make her
appearance here.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THIRD OFFICER</p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOURTH OFFICER</p>

<p>Who? How can you ask? The great, the only one. She of whom
everyone speaks&mdash;the Ex-Empress of the rebels.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIFTH OFFICER</p>

<p>Ah, the goddess! So now we are going to see her.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">SIXTH OFFICER</p>

<p>And we can judge of her supernatural power&mdash;&mdash;unless she
has lost it.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOURTH OFFICER</span></p>

<p>Oh, power she still has. Yesterday evening, by order of the
Emperor, two eunuchs were decapitated simply for having
announced to her the death of her son without preliminary
forms.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">THIRD OFFICER</p>

<p>And I know something, too, from the Governess of the
Palace&mdash;&mdash;To-day the goddess deigned to speak, to request
mourning garments&mdash;&mdash;So they searched the wardrobes of the
late Empress Regent for all that was most magnificent in
the way of white robes and shoes!</p>

<p>Arise, friend, we are alone. You have already guessed my
project, have you not? I want her to come here, near me.
[<i>Pointing to the throne.</i>] Pale and in the white of her
deep mourning as she is, I want her to come here, to sit
beside me on my throne&mdash;&mdash;To-day, I am going to present her
to my people as my affianced bride. Let the Dignitaries of
my Court prostrate themselves before their Empress, at the
same time as before their Emperor&mdash;&mdash;without her there is
neither Empire nor triumph for me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>She has consented?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Alas, I do not know if she will agree. I have postponed
till now that meeting so full at once of charm and terror.
It is to-day and here that we shall see each other again
for the first time&mdash;&mdash;May Heaven help me! You will say
that I am still a child; I wished to invest our supreme
moment with all magnificence. Ah, if only there were not
between us the death of her son, I should tremble less.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</p>

<p>But you did all in your power to save him. Since your
conscience cannot reproach you, sire, it is better for your
plans that the child should be resting in peace among the
shades. To impose him upon your Tartars would have been
dangerous indeed&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whereas now, the two Dynasties may
blend, another son be born, of your blood and hers.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>A son born to me by her! Oh, friend, be silent. The dreams
that are too beautiful, one must not speak of. [<i>He strikes
the gong lightly.</i>] But come, the dreaded moment of seeing
her again has arrived. Come! [<i>To an</i> Official <i>who enters
in response to the gong.</i>] Let the prisoner be brought
here, with all the respect which I have commanded. Go!
[<i>Recalling the</i> Official <i>as he is leaving.</i>] Wait a
moment! [<i>To</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FOUNT</span>, <i>who is going too.</i>] No, her pride
would be offended at being ushered into my presence.
Rather, let her be the first to arrive, and I will follow,
appearing before her with the air of one vanquished,
begging pardon. [<i>To the waiting</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OFFICIAL</span>.] As soon as I
leave, bring the Empress here and leave her alone. Now you
may go!</p>

<p>She loves you, sire. Have confidence. Who is the woman,
even though she be almost a goddess, who would not yield?</p>

<p>She! Only she!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

spilt by traitors despite my command! How has my decree of
pardon been intercepted or changed to a death warrant!&mdash;&mdash;The
hate, the implacable hate of our two peoples ever
triumphs.</p>

that crowd where we were so alone, when she gazed upon me,
when our souls were united in one supreme rapture&mdash;&mdash;But

<p>You? You here?&mdash;&mdash;Dear Prince&mdash;&mdash;Have we then departed this
life? Is this our reunion beyond the grave? If not, whence
have you come, how, by what witchcraft have you passed
these dreadful walls?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span> [<i>Still prostrated</i>] Boldness does not
count the cost, when there is no longer anything to
lose&mdash;&mdash;And, beyond all doubt, the gods were with me&mdash;&mdash;
Yes, I entered as if by witchcraft as you say, I passed
the walls and the guarded gates&mdash;&mdash;One of his soldiers
acted as my guide&mdash;&mdash;I gave him all the gold I had left.
Forgive me, I am weeping, I know not whether for joy or
grief. For joy it must be&mdash;since my only wish was for this
one privilege&mdash;to see Your Majesty for the last time, to
tell her on my knees of my passionate adoration&mdash;&mdash;which
at the gates of death cannot be an offence&mdash;&mdash;and above
all to offer her the wondrous gift, which will deliver her
from the conqueror's worst outrages. My mission as faithful
subject is now concluded by this last service, by the
glorious present which I have brought to my Empress.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Poison! [<i>With a triumphant cry of deliverance.</i>] Ah!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span> [<i>Offering her a dagger</i>] Poison, alas! I
was unable to bring. This is the best I can offer.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Ah, well, that will answer the purpose. Kill me before He
comes!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span> [<i>Rising and drawing back in horror</i>]</p>

<p>My well beloved sovereign!&mdash;&mdash;Ask not that of your faithful
servant, who has always obeyed you. Do not command him to
do what is beyond his strength.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>You will not?&mdash;&mdash;Then give it to me! I will strike myself.
I will make the attempt. I shall succeed.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAITHFUL PRINCE</span> [<i>Noticing that her hands are tied</i>]</p>

<p>But your hands&mdash;&mdash;To think that I had not seen!</p>

<p>Because&mdash;over yonder&mdash;the last heads are falling. They
are calling for those that remain. It is time&mdash;my turn

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>[<i>Far away, her eyes still lowered.</i>] To recognise him, I

<p>Your voice is no longer yours. Your eyes are no longer
yours. You stand here before me, yet your soul seems to be
at an infinite distance. I did not expect to find you so,
and you frighten me. The Majesty of death is upon you.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>They are calling to me from the Land of the Shades. Allow
me to cross the threshold soon, from you I can accept no
mercy. My faithful ones, my warriors, are wondering at my
delay in rejoining them, and my son is listening to catch
the echo of my footfall behind him on the dark path.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Your son!&mdash;&mdash;Ah! Your son! Who has mourned him more than
I, excepting only you? Ten of my couriers, my swiftest
horsemen, were sent at once, riding their horses night and
day, spurring them to death, leaving their corpses by the
roadside, in a frantic effort to arrive in time and avert
the evil which could not be repaired&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>What was achieved? Where is the body of my little son?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>It is now in an imperial hearse, making its slow way to the
north, preceded by funeral music, followed by a thousand
dignitaries in costumes of state befitting the rank of a
young sovereign.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>And where are they taking him, my son?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>To those inviolable forests where the Tartar Emperors
repose. There, in a vale, which the spade of men has never
touched, two leagues of dark cedars will envelope in their
silence, his tomb built all of porcelain.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Will you grant me the favour to sleep near him?</p>

<p>But&mdash;&mdash;in accordance with the custom of the Empresses, you

will have the long marble avenues built&mdash;&mdash;so that all may
be in readiness when your hour strikes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>My hour <i>has sounded</i>&mdash;ah! many days ago. I heard it, but
my hands were tied and your guards were ever about me. Now
you will give me my last freedom, will you not? so that I
may join all the dead heroes who are awaiting me. To keep
me back would be unworthy of you, my noble enemy. You would
not do that!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>After a pause</i>]</p>

<p>Keep you back, you?&mdash;&mdash;O! no, not I&mdash;&mdash;But your

in your duty!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Excitedly at last</i>]</p>

<p>My duty! What duty? Already have I been decoyed by that
word. They urged me thereby to flee like a common woman
beset by fear. While all my brave defenders knew how
to die heroically, my soldiers, my princes, even my
ladies-in-waiting, I like a coward escaped through the
subterranean passages of my palace&mdash;&mdash;to fulfil my duty! It
was the hour when my soldiers were falling by the thousand,
struck down by yours, when my walls were crumbling under
the assault of your armies&mdash;&mdash;the draught of the Great
Deliverance had been brought me in a cup, and I was calm
as I am now&mdash;but smiling. I was about to raise the cup
to my lips, to pass beyond the reach of all, proud and
inviolable, in my imperial attire. The vaults beneath
the ground, the sleeping place of my ancestors, unknown
to your Tartars, stood open close at hand, and there was
still time to carry me down into them&mdash;&mdash;But duty! Ah! my
duty, it appeared, was to flee, and I yielded&mdash;&mdash;And until
the day when your soldiers took me captive, I wandered on
and on through the country, at the head of my defeated
troops&mdash;&mdash;I, the Empress, the Invisible, desecrating my
majesty among all those thousands of men&mdash;&mdash;marching before
them like some mad woman!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Say rather that you were the sublime heroine, the great
warrior-Empress, the goddess of battle, who braved arrows
and bullets, and will live on eternally in poetry and
history!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>I sought to justify my flight, that was all. I did all
I could, but none can ever atone for a cowardly action.
It was in my own palace that I should have met my death,
in the funeral fire lighted by my own hand, in which so
many heroes were consumed&mdash;&mdash;My ashes should have mixed
with theirs. Duty, do you say? But do you believe that I
still belong to Earth? My cities are in ruins, my armies
annihilated, my son dead. And at this very moment I know
that one by one the heads of my few remaining soldiers
are falling into the dust beneath your high Tartar walls.
Then what duty remains, I ask you? [<i>She takes the dagger
from the fold of her robe and raises her hand to strike
herself.</i>] Nothing, nothing but this! [<i>The Emperor rushes
towards her with a cry, seizes her wrist, takes the dagger,
and hurls it to the ground.</i>] Ah! So you dare to touch me
now?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>Bowing very low</i>]</p>

<p>Your pardon! Only listen to me. You may die afterwards
if you wish it, I promise you&mdash;but in some less terrible
way&mdash;&mdash;without this bloodshed. I will even furnish you the
means, if you still wish it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>With sudden gentleness</i>]</p>

<p>In some less terrible way! Yes, that is what I desire. The
Potion of the Great Deliverance, we sovereigns are never
without it. You have it too, have you not?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Night and day within easy reach, especially since you
began to risk your life hourly, in the thick of the
battle. I feared that I should be unable to capture alive
my beautiful Phoenix of War! Be assured, we have the
Deliverance. It is in this golden case, among the trinkets
at my girdle.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>And you will give it to me?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>You swear it?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Yes. After you have listened to me, I shall have this
supreme courage. To refuse you would be unworthy of you and
of myself. But, after you have heard me, only afterwards&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Well, speak, sire. In return for your promise, take the
last minutes in which my ears can hear, my eyes can see&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The same. An</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OFFICIAL</span></p>


<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>He strikes the gong gently, an</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OFFICIAL</span>
<i>appears. To the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OFFICIAL</span>] Double the number of guards at

whatever, dares to open that door before I sound the gong

<p>[<i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OFFICIAL</span> <i>turns to go.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>Wait! [<i>Pointing to the incense-burners on the steps of the
throne.</i>] Incense! Let the sticks be lighted at once! I
must have perfume in the air. [<i>The <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OFFICIAL</span> hastily lights
the bundles of sticks and the smoke rises.</i>] It is well, go!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> Official <i>makes his exit backward,
almost prostrate.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<hr class="r5" />

<h5>SCENE IX.</h5>


<p>The <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>To the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span>, <i>who is leaning against
the balustrade of the throne</i>] Alas! I can read obstinate
resolution in your eyes! You have determined to die, I know
it! I shall speak without hope. Will you grant me one last
favour?</p>

<p class="p2" style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>No doubt I shall. But what may it be?</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>Pointing to the throne</i>]</p>

<p>Let our last interview take place there! Once in your life,
though it be on a day which shall know no to-morrow, I wish
to see you seated upon the throne of the Tartar conquerors.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Very calmly and indifferently</i>]</p>

<p>Is it only that? If that will give you pleasure, I consent.
[<i>She begins to ascend the steps.</i>] I mount but slowly:
I am crushed and fainting. The poison which you promised
lulls one to sleep, does it not? It does not sharpen and
distort the features, I hope. The Phoenix, even in the
agony of death would wish to retain some charm.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>In the same mood</i>]</p>

<p>It is even better than you hope. It comes from the Western
Barbarians. Lustrous pearls under a thin leaf of gold.
One passes into space in a sudden sleep, an exquisite
intoxication&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Still far away</i>] Ah!&mdash;&mdash;in a sleep&mdash;[<i>They have
reached the top of the steps. She half reclines across the
throne, which is almost as large as a divan. The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span>
<i>remains standing.</i>] Well, now&mdash;&mdash;delay no longer, speak&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>It was not the prompting of a mere whim which urged me to
see you seated there. What we have to say is so solemn. The
interview of an Emperor and an Empress, power speaking to
power!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At this height, raised above our earthly personalities, we
shall feel more conscious of our superhuman mission.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Power speaking to power? I am no longer anything but a
captive, who counts for naught.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>You are sovereign and doubly sovereign now, mistress of the
destiny of China, arbiter of all. [<i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> <i>looks at
him as though deeply hurt.</i>] Mistress of the destiny of
China, yes! Be not offended. I do not intend to speak of
your power over the Emperor&mdash;&mdash;But, defeated and captive,
what does it matter? Are you not always the Daughter of
the Mings? Hundreds of millions of hearts bear secret
allegiance to you. The rebellion quelled to-day by my
soldiers will break out afresh to-morrow, will always be
renewed. You are the only being in the world who has the
power to still it for ever&mdash;&mdash;and that takes away the right
to die&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Interrupting</i>]</p>

<p>The dead await me&mdash;&mdash;I belong to them now&mdash;&mdash;I hear their
voices calling to me to come&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>I want to tell you in the fewest words. But I feel as
though you were already gone, already cold. I press on
and I am all at a loss. It seems as if I were speaking to
a tombstone. Powers, you and I, I said, ah, yes, great
powers! Two rival lives of fabled emperors, of deified
heroes, growing feebler and feebler by centuries of
slavery to rites and forms, prisoners in an excess of
luxury; two dynasties that seemed doomed to an immortality
of mummyhood, have by some miracle produced you and me,
who are alive and young. As a result of our union, a new
China might arise, living like us, to dominate the world.
Together we might accomplish that holy mission for the
well-being and happiness of our races, and the eternal
glory of our two united names. But without you, no, I can
do nothing. I shall sink again into my gilded solitude, my
sickly idleness, my opium-drugged sleep. If you but knew
my youth, how isolated and lonely, spent in an apartment
decorated in black ebony! In the gloom of this palace, an
imaginative child, I outlined this glorious plan of union
with you. It haunted my brain. Then your son would have
been my son. It was like a child still that I set out on
that adventure to see you in your palace at Nanking. And as
I beheld, my man's will, which still floated in the midst
of dreams, was suddenly concentrated upon one definite
desire. Ah, what obstacles I overcame! First, I had to
escape from your palace; then to return here unhindered
within the terrible walls of the Yellow City; and then
to wrest the power from those grim evil-doers who had so
long tortured my youthful will and my reason. The war was
already at its height, hatred was enchained, the smell of
blood was in the air, and Chinese and Tartars were howling
like wild beasts. All this, you know full well, I was
unable to stop.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>I know.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>That I did all in my power to save your son&mdash;you believe
that, do you not?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Now I believe it.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>My only reason for speaking of these things is that at
least you may not hate me.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Still calm and impersonal</i>]</p>

<p>I have no hate for you.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>The heads of your faithful soldiers which have just fallen
were sacrificed against my will. I had issued an order of
unconditional pardon. As to the Prince who left you a few
minutes ago. [<i>Smiling</i>]&mdash;for I see all, I the Phantom
Emperor, as you called me&mdash;yes, he who was speaking to
you in this very place and went so heroically to meet his
death, will be saved. You shall see him again!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>I thought you before now a great and generous enemy.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Of my love I have not even dared to speak to you.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>I am grateful to you that you have kept our interview above
that level.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Every word you utter falls upon me like the icy drops of
slow winter rain, and yet withal I must have the force to
proceed to the end. Listen to what I now shall say; it is
the last word I shall speak, after that you will be free.
Despite that dreadful war to the death between us, despite
that funeral procession which now slowly carries your son
to the forests of the Last Repose, I still indulged in the
beautiful dream of putting an end to ancient hates by means
of our marriage, of making one our two rival dynasties, of
giving to the great empire peace everlasting&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Interrupting</i>]</p>

<p>Ever since you asked me to be seated upon your throne, I
understood.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>After a pause</i>]</p>

<p>And your reply?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>My reply is that, neither living nor dead, will I permit
the Emperor of the Tartars even to touch my hand. It is too
late; too many rivers of blood flow between us.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Still one word, one last word. We are not alone at this
solemn historical hour, in this place which seems so empty
and silent. The shades of warriors and the illustrious
spirits of departed emperors are all about us, listening
anxiously for your decision. Your beloved dead are all
here, at peace with mine in the lofty harmony of heaven.
You are mistaken, they are not calling to you to join them;
they are commanding you to live for years to come, to aid
me in this great work of peace, of which I dream and which,
without you seated at my side on this throne, I shall be
powerless to carry out. You have not the right to decline
this duty! In the name of the thousands of invisible
spirits who surround us, I beg of you, Daughter of Heaven,
to live! [<i>A silence.</i>] I have said all that I find
possible to say. I await your decision. I have finished.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Growing colder and more distant in her attitude,
pointing to the golden jewel-case attached to the Emperor's
girdle</i>] Then give it to me now!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>In absolute despair</i>]</p>

<p>No, no! Give it to you with my own hands I cannot. Have
pity&mdash;&mdash;I cannot! I cannot!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Severely</i>]</p>

<p>But your promise, sire, your imperial word of honour. Give
it to me!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span>, <i>after another silence, kneels
before her, takes the golden box from his
girdle and hands it to her slowly, his face
turned downward to the ground.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>After opening the box, speaking gently, like
a child in a dream.</i>] Yes, they are tiny, shining
pearls&mdash;&mdash;And they will bring death, peace, nothingness.
[<i>She puts the pearls in her mouth, then throws the box
to the ground, and rises in exaltation. Triumphant and
dominating the room, she addresses the invisible spirits
of her forefathers.</i>] Oh, my ancestors, behold me! Am I
not glorious? You see me in that place whence you of old
dominated the world, and it is upon your throne, usurped
by the Tartar, that I am about to die! Your daughter has
remained worthy of her race. Despite temptation more than
human, she has kept her word. Open wide before the portals
of death,&mdash;to receive her among you. [<i>Smiling and quite
gentle, she turns to the <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> who is still kneeling.</i>]
And now that my mission is accomplished, approach me,
sire. [<i>She takes his hand gently, to indicate that he may
rise and be seated.</i>] For the second time in her life, the
Empress invites you to be seated in her presence, as once
before, over there, you remember, one morning in my palace
which is now no more&mdash;&mdash;[<i>She seats herself on the throne
again.</i>]</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>Dreamily</i>]</p>

<p>As once before, there in your garden on that
never-to-be-forgotten morning. All about us, the wonderful
flowers of distant lands were unfolding their petals, still
moist with the early dews&mdash;&mdash;and the beautiful Imperial
Phoenix was brilliant in all her glory. [<i>He seats himself
on the throne near her, his head resting against the back.</i>]</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>To-day, the flames have swept away those flowers, and the
Phoenix is in agony, her wings burned in the fire of war.
But, on the threshold of the Great Beyond, she will confide
to you her deepest secret. Now it is your turn to listen.
[<i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> <i>raises his head and looks at her.</i>] While
you were uttering those noble and magnificent words of
sacrifice&mdash;&mdash;Oh! beneath my impassive mask, what a struggle
was mine on to be deaf to their appeal! And I should have
yielded, if the duty which you presented to me had been
only a painful duty. But it would have been too easy and
too sweet. For I loved you! [<i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> <i>arises</i>.] And,
living, I have no more the right to happiness, because it
was I who lighted that great funeral pyre of men's lives in
my palace.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>Interrupting, exultantly</i>]</p>

<p>O my sovereign! O my beautiful, fading flower! To hear
that from your lips at the moment when they are about to
grow cold for ever! Oh! To be beloved by you, I could not
believe it possible. And now no aid can come from men or
gods.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>No aid? Do you think I would accept it? I have spoken only
because I know I am going to die. Aid! But did I not tell
you it was I who lighted the pyre, this hand which set to
it the flaming torch. And as they threw themselves into the
glowing furnace, dying for my son and for me, I cried out
my solemn vow: Soon I come to the Land of the Shades, I
come, I follow you. After that, if I were to live, to spend
a happy life with you&mdash;&mdash;I should loathe myself. [<i>She
remains seated, the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> <i>kneels at her feet, resting
his head on the cushions of the throne.</i>] In entering your
palace, I was afraid of myself, it was only myself that I
feared&mdash;&mdash;for at no time did I hate that strange impostor
who appeared in my palace one day, never did I hate him
even when I knew not, when I did not understand. And in the
closed litter in which I was brought to Peking, at every
stage of that mournful journey my fears and my anguish
increased, according as the impression became stronger and
stronger, until at last I was convinced that you were the
Emperor! [<i>Suddenly terrified, she starts up.</i>] You have
not deceived me? Tell me, it is indeed death which you have
given me? Oh, no, you could not have done that. You are too
noble to have led me into a trap&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>No, my sovereign, no, I have not deceived you. Death is
close to you, it is in your heart, inevitable death.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Will it take long? How many minutes are still left to me?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>Minutes? Oh, scarcely seconds. You are on the point
of slipping away from me into nothingness. The frail
covering of gold leaf still protects you. As soon as that
dissolves&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>I shall suffer?</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>Tell me how I shall pass away.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</p>

<p>You will hear a ringing in your brain as if the great
bell of honour were being sounded for you&mdash;and then a
dizziness&mdash;and suddenly will come eternal peace! [<i>He rises
and rends his garments.</i>] O Gods, if you are capable of
compassion, look down upon me&mdash;&mdash;have pity!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>At first very slowly, pacing the platform of the
throne like one in a dream.</i>] Whither am I going? Who can
tell me whither I am going, where I shall soon be? To the
dead? to the Shades, what can it matter how I use this last
flicker of my life, so soon to be extinguished? Now that
I have kept my word, at least this last moment belongs to
me, which to us is worth Eternity. [<i>To the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span>.] Let
it be mine that I may give it to you! [<i>She seats herself
on the throne again.</i>] Come close to me, my beloved, my
master, my God&mdash;&mdash;[<i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> <i>sits near her, at first
as with religious awe.</i>] Come, I desire to rest my head on
your shoulder while I die&mdash;&mdash;[The <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> takes her in his
arms.] Do you not see that we are like two stars, separated
by a boundless abyss, but withal making desperate efforts
to flash their light to each other?&mdash;&mdash;But now the abyss is
crossed and my mortal enemy is weeping tears for love in my
embrace. Let me rest against your breast, come closer, with
all your being, that I may pass away as though in you.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>Embracing her more passionately</i>]</p>

<p>In me and with me, for I shall follow you, my beautiful
Phoenix, that would fly away beyond my reach&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</p>

<p>No! Remain on earth, live on to keep the love which I have
given you. Who else would remember me and pay the honours
to my spirit? In the valley of eternal silence, amid the
marble avenues, under the shade of the dark cedars, who
else would come to dream of my vanished beauty, that was
but for a day? Promise me you will stay. But come still
closer to me. If you do not fear the last breath of one who
is dying, press your lips against mine, my beloved, that I
may at least have known the rapture of your kiss&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> [<i>Pressing his lips to hers desperately</i>] Oh! Even
your ashes would be lovely to me, even your body in decay.
Fear! you ask if I fear? Respect alone will unlock my
embrace&mdash;when I feel that the breath of life is no more.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPRESS</span> [<i>Wandering, half drawing herself away</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah! Yes&mdash;I hear the great bell sounding. It is the signal,
then? I am sinking&mdash;&mdash;Hold me up, my beloved. Keep me from
sinking thus&mdash;&mdash;into the abyss.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>During an instant of silence, they remain
embraced. Then the</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">EMPEROR</span> <i>rouses himself,

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
